#  Iris Flower Classification Using Machine Learning.

 Classification on Iris Flower dataset is usually referred to as the “Hello World” of Machine Learning. The iris flowers dataset contains numeric attributes, and it is perfect for beginners to learn about supervised ML algorithms, mainly how to load and handle data. Also, since this is a small dataset, it can easily fit in memory without requiring special transformations or scaling capabilities.
 
 The data set contains 3 classes with 50 instances each, and 150 instances in total, where each class refers to a type of iris plant. Classes are 3 species of Iris Flower : 
 -  Iris-setosa
 -  Iris-versicolor
 -  Iris-virginica
 
 Species of Iris-Flower is different by its sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width.
